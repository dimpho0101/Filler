# Filler
The aim of this project is to create a game called filler. In the game I had to create the best algorithm to beat my opponent.


I have added my libft and resources provided by the school. To play, follow these instructions:

1.git clone repo.
2.make.
3.cd into resources.
4. Type in ./filler_vm -p1 ../filler"my executable" -p2 ./players/"your choice of player" -v -f ./maps/map00

for instance: /filler_vm -p1 ../filler -p2 ./players/champely.filler -v -f ./maps/map00
I am player 1 and I choose to play against player champely.

My algorithm is strong as P2. Have fun
